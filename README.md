# Sleeper_Fantasy_Scoreboard_Extension
Sleeper Fantasy Scoreboard Extension is a Chrome extension that uses simple DOM manipulation to display conditionally formatted updates to your fantasy football scoreboard.

# Description
This extension calculates the difference between your score and your opponents, as well as provides a "heat map" of your players' scoring compared to your opponents.

# Motivation
On Sundays I need to know exactly how much I am winning or losing by. I would always manually be calculating this number. I also like to visually see where I'm getting outscored on my team - where are my weaknesses?
